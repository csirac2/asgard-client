# Subscriptions

**To access the free packages, no subscription is required. You don't even need
a license key. You can just download ASGard and run with it.**

Up-to-date information on the subscription plans we offer can be found on the
[ASGard website](https://asgard.paragonie.com/plans).

There are three types of packages we manage:

* **Free Packages** - Free packages are chosen for the benefit of the community.
  Once a package is free, we will not revoke its status.
* **Shared Packages** - These packages are managed by us and available to all of
  our subscribers. You'll need a valid license key and active subscription to
  benefit from ASGard's auditing and verification features.
* **Private Packages** - Package metadata is restricted to a single license key
  through the use of public key cryptography. This option is ideal for 
  proprietary software. Encrypted metadata is still tracked in the same ledger
  as free and shared packages, to ensure *userbase consistency*.

You may get a subscription through [our website](https://asgard.paragonie.com).
Note that if you provide a GnuPG public key when subscribing, our license key
will be encrypted so only the person in possession of the private key can read 
it.
