# Changelog v0.9.0 -> v0.9.1

## Development

* 

## Administrative

* @jedisct1 changed our install script to stop if the tests fail. :+1:
* @jedisct1 updated our installer to use PECL libsodium 0.1.3 (from 0.1.2).
* Change our `install.sh` strategy to have a different script for every major
  GNU/Linux and *BSD distro. This prevents us from having to maintain a massive
  monolithic shell script.
* Fleshed out the Quick Start for the manual.
